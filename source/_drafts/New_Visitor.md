The site is maintained by a 17-year-old, who's getting 18 next year.

He lives in Shanghai, China with or without a name.

This site is not made to adhere to anyone's aesthetic view, nor viewpoints.

It's just a place where some words are shelved, maybe phrases, notes, or photos.

I like the way I keep it. It's like a window that I sometimes glance out and others glance in, and share our ideas.

It's a good way to be free and not alone.

The project has just initiated last summer, and it will grow.

I hope to make it a memo of my life, and maybe a little shed of light or yours.

PS:  So far the site' just a Minimum Viable Product. No cellphone compatibility. No artistic design. No muti-language support.

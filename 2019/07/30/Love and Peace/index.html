		<p><strong>1. They’re all done in one string.</strong></p>
<p>The first time I met that old man, I barely noticed him. I was hurrying among the busy street of Rhode Island, where cafes and fast food stores align next to each other, populated by locals and foreigners, with black and yellow hairs, white and brown skins. Summer was a good season for this place. The golden spots shaded on the wooden buildings through the fostering leaves, leaving an impression to any visitors that shine in their memories.</p>
<p>I was just literally hanging around the street, trying to remember all the sceneries that appear on my side, so when he spoke to me for the first time, I didn’t bother stopping affront his little stall. His way of greeting varies among people. He would sprout a “Hurray” to those natives, and then say, “all hand-made necklace!” And the first time he saw me, he instead said some Chinese phrase: “Hello! Ni Hao Ma? Xie Xie!” It was a kind of friendliness that really makes you stay, though it doesn’t really help his sales. His little displaying desk, two wooden boards on trolleys, covered by silk sheets on the top tinted purple and dark blue, seems like a collector of 60s. Except the plastic blue public chairs by the shop windows and the black desks paired with them, he is the only thing featured dark in the whole street. Only when the summer breeze suddenly gained its strength and pushed aloft the cloth dragging down by the side of his planks, will its pace correspond the business of the street. But as soon as the wind shut, they remained their normal, gentle breeze, so slow-motioned that seemed to be out of time.</p>
<p>His little business wasn’t going well. I could tell by the numbers of deals I see within the long days I spend with him. In each morning, he would come to his designated market place not at the dawn but at ten o’clock, when the coolness of the morning breeze has turned into the empowered, lukewarm radiation. And when he goes he would wear an old shirt and a cap, just like a visitor hanging casually around, and say a friendly greet to anyone who comes nearby. If it wasn’t his fascinating creations lying on the table, I would take him as the laziest merchant in the world.</p>
<p>After setting his cart and panels, he would take out his silk robe of merchants, and carefully unroll them so that all the stuffs it contained would lie on the table. He has two robes, one with gold, metal necklaces, the other full of his own creation. The first table is higher than the other, and the reflections of the metal pieces will dizzy your eyes. The second table is rather different. Unlike the shiny jewelries on the other table, these works are much more introvert as they don’t reflect the sunlight, but they felt so enriched, like something must be hidden within. “It’s called a Mandala, from India.” He points to a piece of work. It’s a twine of timber wire, patterned like a flower, in a religious shape that you can find in the ancient East. And on his table you can also find a Taiji and a Christian Cross. “Balance. People in different places create different religions, but they all seek for balance. Indian people have Mandala, and Chinese people have Yin and Yang. Black and whiteness fused together to form a circle, like a Mandala of light.”</p>
<p>He apparently cares a lot more about his handcrafts than being a jewelry merchant. For whole days, except for talking with friends coming by from all over the town, he would stand in front of his stall and weave the wires. Talking about what he’s most proud of, he would state with a confident grin: “They’re done in one string.” He convinced his audience that his handcrafts were no way normal. And actually there’s far more than religion that you can find on his table. “See! The bike, the shark, the anchor… done by one string!” I couldn’t understand at first how it was possible to form all these various, lively, unpredictable shapes only by intertwining a line with itself, for tens and hundreds of times. No matter what shape was in demand, he would always have some way to figure it out. It must had been result of tens of years of experience, I thought. The way he held the string and stared into the loops, is a type of confidence, just like an professional dancer preparing to show her performance to her own mother.</p>
<p>“It’s wisdom.” He told me, “I’ve been to a lot of places, and I know about people.” It might be, I thought. But I didn’t understand it until I heard about his story. And wisdom is in fact an obscure expression. What did he mean by wisdom? I not yet had an answer, but I could see and feel, those of - darkness and brightness, Yin and Yang, exchange of jewelries and weaves, a Mandala in one string… Something seems to be there, that you couldn’t touch but could only feel. It was like – interconnection. Maybe his wisdom is buried inside them, just like his own story, like a string intertwined to an artwork, you can spend a day or a life sitting there, hearing him talking about it, and slowly untwist the complex existence in his life, maybe also in yours.</p>
<p>And it might be the reason his business wasn’t really well, because he was definitely saving his soul for something else. When a 20s man came by and asked, “Hey, you’re selling these every day?” He would reply, “I don’t sell. I sell when you want to buy.” He was a business person only for several seconds each day, at the instances that he took the desired merchandise from his table, and put the bucks into his wallet. In the other times, which was almost no less than the whole day, you would find an old man sitting beside his displaying table of handcrafts, talking to his friends, playing guitar, watching the people, in the Sayles Street, the exhibition of people’s lives. It was not enough to call him a street artist. Maybe he was a philosopher, might also be a historian, a indigenous scholar working on his life-time thesis on human.</p>
<p>So I would stay, for I’d been too tired of the people elsewhere, of my love and passion getting drained by the endless chores. I needed a refresh, and I needed to hear some stories, to see something real about people, and try to understand something real about them. I didn’t expect to find all those from the old man’s little stall, but I was sure that I would find some, since a day in the secret universe had already been a pleasure. And here he began to tell his story. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>2. When I was seventeen</strong></p>
<p>“When I was 17, same as your age, I had already been to a lot of places.” He is not a native American, though he looks like one. It’s might because old people all look the same. Now he has the identical white hair as any other old man, dressed up casually but no way special. The only thing that is still private for him might be his wisely smile, and his Spanish accent. I shouldn’t have understood his english so well, if it wasn’t his passionate tone that I can’t bear to miss. </p>
<p>When talking about Spanish, his accent was toned up with an extra layer of familarity. He would mock the ways people greet in Spain, or talk about flamingo, the Spanish dance, with her limbs waving and dancing in the air. It was probably a long time since he left his motherland without going back. The licence card he hanging on his chest was full of scraches that attained from age. How time had been fleeting! This is the fiftieth year in this country, the Sayles Street.</p>
<p>In the age of 17, he came to America. It must be free. What was America like fifty years ago? That’s when the Cultural Revolution wan’t yet ceased in China, and the Soviet Union was not yet disparted. The world was tenseful, the Cold War – but people are still living their lives. Here in the Rhode Island, art and music flourish like the sunrise, as usual. It’s probably when the modernization was not so widespread, and he could hike through every state in America, to see how American people walk and behave, to learn English, to learn to play guitar as a life-making skill, to meet friends – bankers and street musicians. </p>
<p>He knew a lot of languages, and he learnt them from the people. I’ve seen how this happened by teaching him a bunch of Chinese words. He was so good at memorizing these pheoics. Rhode Island never lacks foreigners, so no matter where you are from, he knew the right way to grab your attention. “Bunroo! Checka Checka! All hand-made!” And the french guys would turn their heads slightly, respond with a little smile and hand genture, and leave without a stay.</p>
<p>“What’s Checka-checka?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s my own invention. Everyone’s got something that is his own.” Sure. There’s nowhere else you can find his handmade Mandala. “It’s my art. Everyone need to do some art, because it’s how you communicate. Nobody can steal it from me.”</p>
<p>“Emm, even if they manufacture the same texture… They are products, not works anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you are clever.”</p>
<p>Art is really something everyone has to have. </p>
<p>And I play guitar. And Shooo! Somebody threw a worrd at me, “Godra!” Another gives me another word. And I will get them, and I learn how to speak with them! Art is your language. If you go to a place where you don’t know how to speak with the locals – </p>
<p>“You speak by art.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And for me, music.”</p>
<p>I really can start to imagine, what type of a life he was living. Travelling to a foreign place, beside the pedestrian, maybe under the shade of a eave, he put a jar beside the pedestrian, and sit beside it. He played, sang and sent pleasant greetings to all those he know and don’t know, and earned himself pennies that supported him to the next destination. Slowly, he picked up English from conversations from surroundings. It’s not something wealthy, but surely enjoyable for him. And I also began to daydream, to let my imagination lead me back to years ago, beside the dusty lane, the sun shines on his cheek, and I can feel the music in the wind. It’s something perceivable. It’s freedom under the sky. It’s emotion.</p>
<p>“It’s love. Even if I didn’t know the people, as long as I speak with my love, with my music, then everyone can understand. Because love is a language.”</p>
<p>Another time he asked me: “Rui Chi. It means intelligence, right?” </p>
<p>“Rui Zhi.” I pronounced the chinese character carefully, trying to correct his pronunciation. “Yes. It means to be a wise person.”</p>
<p>“I am Rui Chi.” He points to his head, then patted his chest. “Of course you are.” I smiled.</p>
<p>“No, I mean for real. My name is Ruiz.” He said the sentence firmly. He pulled the merchant licence from his chest to let me see his name printed below his portrait: Jose Ruiz. “Rui-zhi.” He said again.</p>
<p>“What an coincidence! Your name just means wisdom in my language!”</p>
<p>“I am wisdom. My dad gave me this name.” He seemed to be proud of this lucky consequence of ending up with a fascinating chinese name, but not too excited. Maybe he had known about it for long. Maybe there’s something hidden.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, again?” He asked as if we had known each other’s names.</p>
<p>“My last name is Liu.” I tried to pronounce it clearly, “again”.</p>
<p>“Leo.” He repeated. “Hi Leo.” He made up for the greeting.</p>
<p>“Good to meet you, Ruiz.” I smiled.</p>
